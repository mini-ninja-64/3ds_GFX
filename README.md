# 3ds_GFX
A lightweight graphics library for the 3ds homebrew scene

#Current State
Working Great-ish images can now load! how to coming soon!

#Reason:
I am making this to port over some things for the 3ds I have made for other low power systems and to have a break from work

#Use:
For your project just add gfx.h to include and gfx.cpp to source :)

#Example:
This can be found in the form of main.cpp, mainScreen.cpp & mainScreen.h in the source

#Requirement:
libctru
